# Dizzo!

It's like a discussion board, only it doesn't work. Yet. But soon it will!

## Manifesto

Creating, sharing, and discussing are three sides of a coin. Right now the
share side is pretty thin, not unlike an actual coin, but that's what this
project sets out to fix. What will it end up like? A thick cylinder-like
coin that can balance on its side or roll around? Maybe! But you know what
else has thick sides and rolls around really well? Wheels! They're pretty
amazing as far as inventions go.

So this should be like the wheel, and when you got wheels on your cart and
you saw all those other pathetic people with their *skids* and their
*sleds*, you'll probably laugh. Except when your wheels get stuck in the mud
and their skids slide right on over. Then you'll be kicking your wheel
and wishing you had sleds. Kind of like a snowmobile.

So it's like that, too. Forums are great! They have a lot to envy. Like users.
That's the one thing this software will never come with. No matter how hard
anyone tries, software is still going to be really boring without people.

What this project sets out to do is to do that forum thing better. To make it
feel like you're engaged with other people, and not just pinning notes to
a literal bulletin board in a literal hall. Who has time for that?

Instead it's about being able to pin things to *your* board, to make your
own collection of awesome stuff, and to share that with others! Yeah, that's
right. You can make your own boards. You can invite other people to them.
You can pin stuff. You can make new things other people can pin. You can
be part of something bigger than what fits on a cork board in a dingy hall
that's already cluttered up with fliers and restaurant menus.

That, in a nutshell, is the vision here.

Crazy? That's for history to decide.

## Features

Hypothetically this is a platform for creating, sharing, and discussing
creative content. What is creative content? Content made by creatives!
Obviously. Why are you even asking this? As a matter of fact, why are you
even looking at this repository? If you wanted a working bulletin board you
should probably download one that has features that work. And code.

In time, as code is written, this platform will do things like let you:

 * Post pictures, create galleries, share and favorite these things.
 * Carry on lengthy discussions with friends, associates, and newly discovered
   adversaries. Hopefully not trolls. Nobody likes those.
 * Share links to content!
 * Organize all this into collections. Who doesn't love that? It's like
   the modern equivalent of scrap-booking only without all the glue on your
   fingers and the glitter ground into the carpet.
 * Solicit feedback! Constructive or otherwise! Hopefully it's more of
   a constructive nature. Nobody wants to be told they suck.
 * Discover new stuff! Why is this so hard, anyway? Oh, right, because most
   "bulletin boards" are awful at sharing. If you don't spend a lot of time
   hunting around, you'll never find anything. This sucks!
 * Chat with other people either in real time, through notes, or via public,
   semi-public, or private message boards.
 * Be part of something bigger and make the internet a better place!
